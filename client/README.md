Going to need a delete or update on the main cards. So a user can get ride of the card if they don't want it any more or they made an accident creating it.

Need to add a check box for the main card.
which is to show the user that they can make their cards public. More the Mine route.
and  The more out a check box will be to add the cards to your storage.


Then, the design portion of the application will be ready.

Then, I can start connecting my routes and work on the server.

Then, create a middle ware so the user cant go back to the main page unless they have log out.

Then i can focus on scaling with redis for the mongodb database and cluster for multiple children.


//Then, after that I work on the graph point rather I find a way to do it with d3.js or a graphing library //but i would need a skip which can go through these cards showing the time increase and decrease of use.
